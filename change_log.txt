1.2 (5/2014)
    - changed plugin stylesheet.css: instead of floating div-s most teasers
      have become inline-blocks + other little changes
    - outcommented clear:both in teaser div, as this doesn't work with
      non floating content areas with floating sidebars
    - removed setting for <div style="clear:both"> at the end. Substitued by "overflow:hidden".
    - query for the toobar variable name for compatibilty with CKEditor4CMSimple 2.1
    - easy updating, just install plugin over existing one and activate it
